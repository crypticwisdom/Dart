  /// Global Scope

  /// You can define a variable in the global scope to use the variable anywhere in your program.
  /// Example 1: Global Scope

  /// String global = "I am Global. Anyone can access me.";
  ///       void main() {
  ///         print(global);
  ///       }
  ///
  /// In this program, the variable named global is a top-level variable; you can
  /// access it anywhere in the program.
  ///
  ///
  /// Note: Define your variable as much as close Local as you can. It makes your
  ///       code clean and prevents you from using or changing them where you
  ///       shouldnâ€™t.
  ///
  ///
  /// Lexical Scope:
  ///       Dart is lexically scoped language, which means you can find the 
  ///       scope of variables with the help of braces {}.
  
  ///
