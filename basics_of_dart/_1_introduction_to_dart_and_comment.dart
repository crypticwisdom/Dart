    Dart: The language

    The Dart language is type safe; it uses static type checking to ensure 
    that a variable’s value always matches the variable’s static type. 
    Sometimes, this is referred to as sound typing. Although types are mandatory, 
    type annotations are optional because of type inference (Giving a value a 
    data-type when there is no datatype specified, by the programmer). 
    The Dart typing system is also flexible, allowing the use of a dynamic type 
    combined with runtime checks, which can be useful during experimentation or 
    for code that needs to be especially dynamic.

    Dart offers sound null safety, meaning that values can’t be null unless 
    you say they can be. With sound null safety, Dart can protect you from 
    null exceptions at runtime through static code analysis. Unlike many other 
    null-safe languages, when Dart determines that a variable is non-nullable, 
    that variable is always non-nullable. If you inspect your running code in 
    the debugger, you’ll see that non-nullability is retained at runtime 
    (hence sound null safety).


  Dart: The platforms

  Dart’s compiler technology lets you run code in different ways:

  Native platform: For apps targeting mobile and desktop devices, 
      Dart includes both a Dart VM with just-in-time (JIT) compilation and an 
      ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler for producing machine code.

  Web platform: For apps targeting the web, Dart can compile for development or 
      production purposes. Its web compiler translates Dart into JavaScript.

    If you want to learn Dart for building cross platform applications with 
    Flutter Framework, you must be very familiar with atleast these concepts:

    1. Variables, Data Types.
    2. Functions.
    3. Checking for Null values. "expression1 ?? expression2";
    4. Fat arrows function. (or Array Syntax used.) Single line function.
    5. Classes. OOP.
    6. Constructors.
    7. Null check for object.
    8. FizzBuzz

    void main(){
      Every Dart program must have this function as this is the entry point to 
      every Dart program, Every code are written inside of it.
    }

    // You can use an online editor like 'DartPad' for writting Dart codes.
