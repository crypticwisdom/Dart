  // Constants are variable that doesn't change.

  // Constant Declaration:
  // Contants are declared with the 'final' OR 'const' dart keyword.

  final PI1 = 3.14; // Constants can be declared with or without a datatype.
  final double PI2 = 3.14; // Constants can be declared with a datatype.

  const PI3 = 3.14; // Constants can be declared with or without a datatype.
  const int PI4 = 3144; // Constants can be declared with a datatype.

  // The 'final' and 'const' keywords are used to keep the value of the variable static in the code base.

  /*
      Differences between 'final' and 'const'.
      - The 'final' keyword is used to hardcode the value of the variable and cannot be altered in the future.
      - The 'const' keyword behaves exactly like the 'final'keyword. The only difference between them is that
        - the 'const' keyword makes the variable constant from compile-time only.

      - The 'static' keyword is used together with the 'const' keyword in a class.
