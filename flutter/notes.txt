- Everything in flutter is a Widget.
- Flutter has this sdk which is a tool that compiles the code to a native platform code.
- My app's ui is a widget tree because everything is a widget.

- Widgets are components, which are the building block of my user iinterface.
e.g bottons, navbar, infact the whole app is wrapped iin a widget.

- every Widget needs to extend StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget.
- every widget is a dart class that specifies the buiild() method
